* Events
    Action or occurances that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired.

* Event Handling - Detecting and responding to an event using JavaScript:
    1. Identify a DOM node to monitor
    2. Identify the event you want to respond to
    3. Create a function to run when the event is triggered
