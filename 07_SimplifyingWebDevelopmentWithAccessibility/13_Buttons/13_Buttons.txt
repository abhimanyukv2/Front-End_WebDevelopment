* Buttons don't do anything out of the box
* Button behavior is added by hooking them to browser events or using JavaScript
* Links are often used in place of buttons
* A common reason is buttons look like button, which is not what the design calls for

* Removing Button Styles in CSS
    button {
        font-family: inherit;
        font-size: 100%;
        line-height: 1.15;
        margin: 0;
        overflow: visible;
        text-transform: none;
        -webkit-appearance: button;
        border: 0;
        background: none;
    }
    button:hover {
        /* Mouse behavior like link */
        cursor: pointer;
    }
    button:hover,
    button:focus,
    button:active {
        background: none;
        border-color: inherit;
        border-radius: 0;
    }

* Working with the <button> Element
    1. Create global styles for all buttons to match design
    2. Use classes to apply custom style where necessary
    3. Modify and build on default styling rather than full reset
