* Accessible Typography Principle
    1. Large font sizes (within reason) are preferred
        * Default size of 16px is OK
        * 18px or 20px is better
    2. Avoid Complex fonts for anything but decoration
        * Handwritteng and decorative fonts look good
        * Are difficult to read
    3. Avoid "fancy" fonts with unusual features
        * Fonts woth stylish ligaments are difficult to read
        * Nonstandard glyphs are difficult to read
    4. Keep max sentence length between 70 and  80 characters
        * Max-width: 70ch; and you are done!
